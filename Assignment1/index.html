<h1>Inland Empire</h1>
<h2>A film by David Lynch</h2> 
<p>This was David Lynch's final feature film, premiering in 2006. I love its use of a cheaper commercial digital camera, despite being lower quality than the majority of other works at that time, it really adds to the surreal nature of the film.
